# Introduction

A collection of `\NewUnicodeChar` declarations for use in LaTeX.

The below instructions are imported here from
[unicode.org](unicode.org). See that file for more details.

The file [unicode.pdf](unicode.pdf) is generated from
[unicode.org](unicode.org) as evidence that the unicode characters are
declared correctly.

## Usage

This file generates (via Org Babel tangling) the file `unicode.sty`.

To use it, either place it in the same directory as your `.tex` file,
and require it via `\usepackage{unicode}`.

Alternatively, place it in your `texmf` directory to allow global usage
on your system. That directory is commonly located at the following
locations on various OS's.

  - Linux
      - `~/texmf/tex/latex/local/`
  - Mac OS X
      - `/Users/<user name>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local/`
  - Windows 10 (and miktex)
      - `C:\Users\<user
        name>\Appdata\Local\MikTex\<number>\tex\latex\local\`
  - Windows Vista/7
      - `C:\Users\<user name>\texmf\tex\latex\local\`
  - Windows XP
      - `C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\texmf\tex\latex\local\`

## Requirements

This package depends upon the packages listed herein.

There are two ways to inform LaTeX of unicode character translations;

  - `\DeclareUnicodeCharacter`; this command does not work with XeLaTeX
    or LuaLaTeX, which I use.
  - `\newunicodechar`; this command is provided by the newunicodechar
    package, which may not be pre-installed for all LaTeX users.

This collection uses the second. The unicode-math package “provides a
complete implementation of unicode maths for XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX”.

## Contributing to this document

This document is written in Emacs using Org mode. While the exported PDF
version, etc., show a collection of LaTeX source blocks, these are in
fact generated by an Emacs Lisp script below.

That means that contributions to this document should modify the Emacs
Lisp script, not `unicode.sty` or the LaTeX source blocks themselves.
